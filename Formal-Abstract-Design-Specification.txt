comment

In the post condition, the details of the sender account are retrieved from current_accounts records and amount to be sent
deducted from its account balance. The details of the receiver account are also retrieved from current_accounts records
and amount sent is added to the receiver  account balance. The current_accounts and account_transfers records are then updated
The updating of the account_transfers records is done by first constructing an object transaction of composite type then
generating a map, to map the sender with the transaction. The map is then concatenated with other existing account_transfers
